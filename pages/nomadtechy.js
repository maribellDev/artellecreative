            <h2>The client</h2>
            <p>
              NomadTechy is an IT managed service provider and provides computer
              and network support for small to medium-sized businesses.
            </p>
            <h2>The challenge</h2>
            <p>
              NomadTechy approached us at the start of the company’s journey and
              was looking for a fresh, friendly identity and a website to
              attract potential clientele. The goal was to make the company
              stand out by communicating approachability and transparency.
            </p>
            <h2>The solution</h2>
            <p>
              We designed a new logo and a visual identity. The website
              organized NomadTechy’s list of services in a simple way, making it
              easy for potential clients to compare services and choose a
              package that fits their needs.

          <div className={style.blog}>
            <h2>New website</h2>
            <p>
              We built a responsive website that was easy to use on a phone, as
              well as on a desktop computer. The new NomadTechy website includes
              a brief introduction for potential clients, an overview of
              services, and a quick way for current clients to get support.
