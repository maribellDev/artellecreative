            <h2>The client</h2>
            <p>
              Shuda Properties is a real estate company from Sedalia, MO,
              specializing in rental properties.
            </p>
            <h2>The challenge</h2>
            <p>
              Alex, the owner of the company found himself spread too thin
              between property showings, email chains and phone calls. He needed
              a simple solution that would act as a hub for current and future
              residents without requiring his 24/7 attention.
            </p>
            <h2>The solution</h2>
            <p>
              The first step in solving Alex’s problem was to design a branding
              identity that would represent the company well today and well into
              the future to sustain the company’s growth. The solution became a
              modular website that can change and evolve with the company’s
              growth.

            <h2>New website</h2>
            <p>
              We built a responsive website that includes an overview of
              properties, a new resident hub with info on payments and easy
              access to required documents, and a contact form for easy
              apartment showings. The navigation and site structure provides an
              easy way for users to find what they’re looking for. The modular
              layout of the website, makes it easy to update and add content as
              the company grows.
