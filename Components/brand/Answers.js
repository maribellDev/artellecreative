            We design and develop in stages, and at each stage, you will be able
            to send your edits and feedback. The process is reiterative and
            because of it, there's an unlimited amount of edits you can request.

            Because there are many factors that vary one company to another,
            like the amount of products, type of product photos, types of email
            templates and more, we encourage you to reach out to us so we can
            build a custom pricing package based on your needs.

            A project like website design or branding can be a significant time
            investment on both sides. So we ask you to be available for edits,
            revisions, feedback, and any needed Zoom meeting in between. Timely
            collaboration, where both parties are invested, brings the best
            results in our experience.
