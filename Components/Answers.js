            It depends on what kind of project we're working on. Websites take
            4-6 weeks, branding 2-4 weeks, marketing materials can take 1-3
            weeks. If you need a fast turnaround (2-3 days) on marketing
            materials for social media, email, or anything else, our design
            retainer might be for you.
