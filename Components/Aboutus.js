                With nearly a decade of experience designing for e-commerce and
                traditional brands, I use design to help companies stand out and
                optimize their websites, branding, and marketing. <br />
                <br /> Early in my career, I joined a creative studio and worked
                with clients in the health and wellness industry, later moving
                on to work for an e-commerce company as part of the in-house
                design and marketing team. Eventually, taking the leap to start
                Artelle Creative and partner with fantastic companies near and
                far. <br />
                <br /> During my free time, I enjoy spending time outdoors and
                use my hobbies as creative fuel for my work.
